## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox

- CSS Grid

- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While building this landing page, I practiced combining CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, and used media queries to create a responsive design that adapts smoothly between mobile and desktop.

For example, to a two column grid layout add spacing between items inside a grid:

```css

.grid-container {
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
gap: 2rem;
}
```

I also used CSS custom properties (:root) to easily manage theme colors across different sections.


### Continued development

I want to add more content and images to the landing page, and explore adding interactive elements like hover effects and animations.

I also want to continue improving the header navigation, especially on smaller screens, and explore adding simple animations to hero text and call-to-action buttons.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs – CSS Grid $ CSS Flexbox – Helped me structure the layout.

The Modern CSS Reset – Helped set  a consistent base  style.
